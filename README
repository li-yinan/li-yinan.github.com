all new design~new architecture~~
in this version, more snakes are enabled 
in next version, we will separate AI strategy
good good study day day up~~

today's 2012.2.16 night
fix many bugs...
seems run well...
maybe we need a net version,people can play vs others 

today's 2012.2.17 night
scorer's done~ 
considering it is too miscellaneously to buy a server to run nodejs...
so,we can't play with other people online
but~we can controll one snake vs many AIs

this is the 0.3 version ~
next version 0.4 is on the way

today's 2012.2.25
we start 0.4 version~
in this version, we will focus on animation&frame controll,maybe some of spirit

today's 2012.3.10
It's long time I haven't wrote readme
but I have never stoped
in these days,I wrote version 0.4,and it works well
my framework turns into RPG & ACTION framework
many thing has done,such as
world,sprite,attack effect,framecontroll(ticker),eventManager,imageLoader
wow,so many~
version 0.4 is a big version,this version number will last much longer...

today's 2012.3.16
These days I have many new ideas, and this version already has a big change,so I decided to end this version, and start v0.5
In version 0.5,there's new designed frame frequency independency ticker and import phisical model to simulate the real world, more about collide detection, I want a accurate and effcient collide detection algorithm
In version 0.4 I found whether I use clip function or not,the canvas render efficiency doesn't change much, so I will don't care so much on region render.maybe oneday canvas can use opengl to render 2d.
